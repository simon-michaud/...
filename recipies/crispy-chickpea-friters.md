# Crispy Chickpea Friters

**Preperation:** 20 minutes

**Cooking time:** 20 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1 cup chickpeas
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 cup refined avocado oil or grapeseed oil, for frying

## Directions

* Add chickpeas to a large bowl and cover with at least 4 inches of water. Allow to sit at room temperature at least 12 hours or overnight. After soaking, drain and rinse well.

* In a food processor, pulse garlic, cilantro, flour, baking powder, cumin and salt until minced. Pulse in lemon juice and olive oil. Add soaked and drained chickpeas to the food processor and pulse until finely minced and mixture is just combined.

* Line a large rimmed baking sheet. Scoop chickpea mixture into portions of approximately 3 tablespoons, placing them on the baking sheet and gently forming into 1/2-inch-tall discs. Freeze for 30 minutes for mixture to absorb flour and firm up.

* Preheat oven to 200ºF. In a large cast-iron or high-sided skillet, add avocado or grapeseed oil and heat over medium-high.

* To test oil temperature, drop a small fritter crumb into oil – it should sizzle. Using a metal spatula, very gently add fritters to hot oil in two batches, cooking for about 5 to 6 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. If browning too quickly, lower the element temperature. Transfer pan-fried fritters to a wire cooling rack set over a large rimmed baking sheet. When all fritters are cooked, keep warm in oven.
